# Introduction to Competitive Programming (CP)
*Imagine all the brightest problem solvers gather under the same roof and **YOU** are there.* 


## What is Competitive Programming?
Competitive Programming (CP, also known as Programming Challenges or Informatics) is a mind sport.
Essentially we want to solve computational problems as quickly and accurately as possible 
using algorithms and data structures. How does this help us as competitors? 

- Improved problem-solving ability\
  \
  As a beginner, chances are you will have a hard time even understanding what a problem wants to ask about. 
  This kind of feeling, where you feel stressed, is actually healthy for us. Being able to adapt to competitive environments where there is time pressure improves our ability to think outside the box. 
  If you keep at it, you will develop the ability to analyse problems quickly and effectively, and recognise the different approaches to solving them.

- It's an awesome way to hone our implementation and general programming skills (especially to ace university programming courses)\
  \
  We are dealing with mostly well documented algorithms and data structures every time we want to solve a problem. While there are problems that will be a straightforward implementation of a standard algorithm, 
  more often than not there will be some kind of observation that will need to be made which allows us to apply algorithms in new ways. 
  The more we practice these kinds of problems, the better our understanding of these algorithms will be. If you're doing it as a hobby, most university programming problems should 
  become a breeze for you.\
  \
- To prepare for programming competitions and technical interviews\
  \
  Compete like you practice and practice like you compete. With all the benefits above, preparing for actual contests (usually online) and technical job interviews are 
  likely going to be what you do everytime with CP. You will get used to what techniques can be applied, what tricks are available (you may not even know that they exist if
  you haven't tried to do CP), what data structures to pick, and what's necessary to do during the timeframe of solving a problem.\
  These are some programming competitions:

  - International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)\
    \
    This is the largest competition for a univeristy level in which you can compete as an undergraduate student with your team of 3. The contest is 5 hours long.\
      There are generally three stages of ICPC in the region UNSW competes in: Divisionals, Regionals, and World Finals.\
      Your team must qualify the Regionals to advance to the World Finals.\
      As a side note, UNSW finished sixth in the 2018 ICPC World Finals, which is the South Pacific region highest accomplishment of all time.

      > "Our region won it in 1990 and 1992 but neither Russian nor Chinese universities were competing back then thus it wasn't as much of a "worldwide" competition as it is now. In addition, the level of difficulty is incomparable."

  - ANZAC League is a contest held in our region by SPCPA regularly to practice the ICPC styles contest.
   - Google's Coding Competitions
     - Kick Start is a contest with multiple rounds. You can compete in as many or as few as you want! 
       It's mainly aimed at people who are newer to competitive programming.
     - Code Jam, on the other hand, is overall more challenging and harder than Kick Start. There are multiple rounds where you need to pass the earlier ones to be qualified.
       The very first round is the Qualification Round (as of 2021, you are allowed to discuss problems during this round, CPMSoc runs discussion sessions for it) &#8594; Round 1 (1A/1B/1C &mdash; you may
       compete in any subround until you qualify for Round 2)
       &#8594; Round 2 (top 4500: taken from each top 1500 in round 1A, 1B, and 1C altogether) &#8594; Round 3 (top 1000) &#8594; The final round (top 25)
    - Facebook Hacker Cup
    - Other regular online contests on Codeforces, Atcoder, Luogu, ORAC, Topcoder, Hackerrank, Codechef, Leetcode, etc.
    - Technical interviews, at least for major companies, will often incorporate some algorithms, techniques and data structures from more standard competitive programming problems. 
      Some common examples are BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, DP, BSTs, prefix sums, stacks, and queues.

- Improve your networking and socialize with like-minded people who are also passionate about problem solving and programming

  You will have chances to meet talented programmers out there and build your community along the way! Note that big companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon,
  are in favor of hiring top performers at the competitions they host!
- The joy of problem solving and that happy face when you smash it out of the park! üëÄ\

## Getting started
- Pick your programming language\
  \
  One of the prerequisites to do CP is knowing how to write and run a code. The ICPC-accepted languages are C++, Python and Java. As a beginner, you may want to continue using 
  whatever language you are most familiar with, as long as whatever platform you want to use supports it. However, as you start looking to more advanced problems, there are some differences between 
  languages that you should be aware of.\
  \
  Python is often known as a beginner-friendly language that is easy to program in. This is generally true but it is often many times slower than equivalent C++ or Java code. Most of the time 
  this is not an issue, but there will be times where it may be incredibly difficult or even impossible to solve a problem in Python because of time constraints. If you are using Python as your 
  primary language, it is recommended to learn a faster language such as C++ or Java to improve your ability to solve problems.\
  \
  Now, between Java and C++, C++ is the more common language, especially at UNSW. COMP4128 Programming Challenges is taught with C++. C++ has a vast standard library, where we only need to fill in types to access useful data structures and algorithms. However, there are some areas that Java beats it in. Java has big integers, regular expressions, and geometry libraries, which are useful in a small number of problems.\
  \
  Most competitors at UNSW currently use Python for simpler problems and switch to C++ for more complicated problems where time may be an issue. If you can only learn one language, we recommend C++, but each has situations where it shines.\
  \
  You can also try other language like Kotlin, Rust or Go to get a taste of how langauges vary. Even [Gennady Korotkevich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennady_Korotkevich), arguably the greatest competitive programmer,
  used to compete using Pascal.

- [CS Academy](https://csacademy.com/contest/archive/tasks/) 
  [Sphere Online Judge](https://www.spoj.com/) and [CSES Problem Set Website](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/) are old classics and recommended websites
  to practice as a beginner.
- The most popular platforms actively try to include beginners. For example, [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) educational rounds, or division 3 and 4 rounds are tailored to beginners. [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/) also has beginner contests. Google Code Jam's Kickstarter rounds also have some interesting problems. These all have editorials readily available so you won't get frustrated being unable to solve a problem.
- Build a solid mathematical foundation and intuition for CP, such as Number Theory, Combinatorics, Probability, Game Theory, and so on. 

## Tips on how to be get better and to be more competitive:
- Step 1: Master your programming language(s)
- Step 2: Identify problems quickly\
  By repeatedly solving problems, you will get a good understanding of which category a problem falls under as soon as you read it.\
  These are problem types in recent programming contest:
    1. Ad Hoc 
    2. Complete Search (Iterative/Recursive) 
    3. Divide and Conquer 
    4. Greedy 
    5. Dynamic Programming 
    6. Graph 
    7. Mathematics
    8. String Processing 
    9. Computational Geometry
    10. Some Harder/Rare Problems
  
- Step 3: Be good at testing code and debugging\
  \
  [uDebug](https://www.udebug.com/) is a nice website where you can find people's input of some past contests problems and compare your output.
  It's almost a sin to not test our solution. Before submitting, make sure that at least your program outputs as the same as samples given. You also want to have
  test cases that include tricky corner cases and large cases.
- Step 4: That one mantra &mdash; ‚ÄúPractice, practice, and practice!‚Äù and upsolve problems as many as you can. Expect that there will be the odds where you face 
  a similar problem to what you have tried/solved.\
  \
  Upsolving is when you solve a problem after the contest ends. If you only do problems during the contest and forget about the ones you didn't solve, it will be very difficult to improve as you aren't learning anything from the contests.
- Final step: If you are in a team contest, communication is key!
  
## How to use Online Judge platforms:
- Read problems &#8594; code &#8594; submit &#8594; let the judge do their work. Then, you shall see the feedback.

- What the verdict says about your solutions (AC, WA, TLE, RTE, CTE, etc.)

  - AC (Accepted): Congratulations! Your solution has passed all the test cases (including the hidden ones) and you are good to go to the next problem.

  - WA (Wrong Answer): You failed on some testcase(s)

  - TLE (Time Limit Exceeded): Your solution's running time exceeded the time limit

    While it is difficult to measure exact wall-clock time of your algorithm just by analyzing the algorithm and code, it is sometimes a good idea to
    benchmark your solution before you submit it to the judge. This way you trade a few minutes of time (constructing the worst-case input) for avoiding many time limit exceeded verdicts. If you are unsure of your solution
    and the competition format penalizes you for rejected submissions, this tradeoff can have good value.

  - RTE (Runtime Error): Your program crashed during execution with the secret test input
