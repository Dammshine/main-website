# Introduction to Competitive Programming (CP)
*Imagine all the brightest problem solvers gather under the same roof and **YOU** are there.* 


## What is Competitive Programming?
Competitive Programming (CP, also known as Informatics) is practically a sport. It's heuristic.
Here, we want to solve computational problems as quickly as possible with our creative solutions 
using some methods called algorithms and harness effective data structures to organise our data. Now, what's in CP for us? 

- It's beneficial to our mental and problem-solving skills

  Chances are, when you are reading this article, you will find a hard time to even understand what a problem wants to ask about. 
  This kind of feeling, where you feel stressed, is actually healthy for us. Being able to adapt to competitive environments where you are haunted by the time pressure is,
  in hindsight, a means to have a positive mental and to be a tenacious person. 
- It's an awesome way to hone our implementation and general programming skills (especially to ace university programming courses)

  We are dealing with mostly algorithms and data structures everytime we want to solve a problem. Exercising numbers of algorithmic problems 
  will do good for our brain as we must have done multiple times of trying different ways of solving them hence it will hone the
  way we think logically and computationally. 
  That way, the more we practice, the better our problem solving skills will be. If you're doing it as a hobby, most of university programming problems should 
  just be a breeze for you.
- To prepare for programming competitions and technical interviews
  
  Compete like you practice and practice like you compete. With all the benefits above, preparing for actual contests (usually online) and technical job interviews are 
  likely going to be what you do eveytime with CP. You will get used to what techniques can be applied, what tricks are available (you may not even know that they exist if
  you haven't even tried to do CP), what data structures to pick, and what's necessary to do during the timeframe of solving a problem.
  These are some programming competitions:
  - ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)
    - This is the largest competition for a univeristy level in which you can compete as an undergraduate student with your team of 3. The contest is 5 hours long.

      There are basically three stages of ICPC: Divisionals, Regionals, and World Finals.
      
      Your team must qualify the Regionals to advance to the World Finals. 
      
      On a side note, our university, the UNSW, finished sixth in the 2018 ICPC World Finals, which is the South Pacific region highest accomplishment of all time.

      > Our region won it in 1990 and 1992 but neither Russian nor Chinese universities were competing back then thus it wasn't as much of a "worldwide" competition as it is now.
      In addition, the level of difficulty is incomparable.
    - ANZAC League is a contest held in our region by SPCPA regularly to practice the ICPC styles contest.
   - Google's Coding Competition
     - Kick Start is a single round contest where throughout the year they provide more than one round and you can participate as many as you want!
       It's mainly aimed at people who are new to competitive programming and not many strong contestants competing.
     - Code Jam, on the other hand, is overall more challenging and harder than Kick Start. There are multiple rounds where you need to pass the earlier ones to be qualified.
       The very first round is the Qualification Round (as per 2021, you are allowed to discuss each problem during this round) &#8594; Round 1 (1A/1B/1C) 
       &#8594; Round 2 (top 3000 taken from each top 1000 in round 1A, 1B, and 1C altogether) &#8594; Round 3 (top 500) &#8594; The final round (top 25)
    - Facebook Hacker Cup
    - Other regular online contests on Codeforces, Atcoder, Luogu, ORAC, Topcoder, Hackerrank, Codechef, Leetcode, etc.
- Improve your networking and socialize with like-minded people who are also passionate about problem solving and programming

  You will be having a chance to meet talented programmers out there and build your community along the way! Note that big companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon,
  are in favor of hiring top performers at the competitions they host!
- The joy of problem solving and that happy face when you smash it out of the park! üëÄ

## Getting started
- Pick your programming language

  One of the prerequisites to do CP is knowing how to write and run a code. C++ has never been absent on the "top programming language for CP" list. 
  
  This stats(https://www.go-hero.net/jam/17/languages) shows how popular C++ at Google Code Jam 2017 (among the best
  3,000 participants, 79% used C++, 16% used Python, and 8% used Java). In fact, no Codeforces toppers (red colored handle) uses Python as their main language
  However, the reason Python may be picked is because it is simpler and it usually
  takes under a minute to code a reasonable complex input generator.
  
  Other primary reason why C++ is by far the best is because it is faster (it is compiled to binary). 
  This [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-fast-is-c-compared-to-python-978f18f474c7) shows that Python is roughly 25 times slower than C++ to run the same algorithm.
  [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/environment) has execution time constant (or even non-constant) multipliers that differs per-language 
  (2s for C++, 4s for Java, and 10s for Python).
  
  Moreover, the [standard library of C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/) (often referred as C++ STL) contains a large collection of data structures and algorithms that
  will be helpful because STL it allows you to simplify your code (implementation) and reduce its size.
  
  Picking what weapon should be in your arsenal is crucial. If you cannot program in C++ yet, now is a good time to start learning.
  This is a good website to learn C++: https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp
  
  Try others for fun! (Kotlin, Rust, Go; even [tourist](https://codeforces.com/profile/tourist)  used to compete using Pascal)

- [CS Academy](https://csacademy.com/contest/archive/tasks/) 
  [Sphere Online Judge](https://www.spoj.com/) and [CSES Problem Set Website](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/) are old classic and recommended websites
  to practice as a beginner.
- Build a solid mathematical foundation and intuition for CP, such as Number Theory, Combinatorics, Probability, Game Theory, and so on. 

## Tips on how to be get better and to be more competitive:
- Step 0: Determination
- Step 1: Master your programming language!
- Step 2: Identify problems quickly!
  These are problem types in recent programming contest:
    1. Ad Hoc 
    2. Complete Search (Iterative/Recursive) 
    3. Divide and Conquer 
    4. Greedy 
    5. Dynamic Programming 
    6. Graph 
    7. Mathematics
    8. String Processing 
    9. Computational Geometry
    10. Some Harder/Rare Problems
  
- Be good at testing code and debugging, remember you are an artist!

  [uDebug](https://www.udebug.com/) is a nice website where you can find people's input of some past contest problems and compare your output.
  It's almost a sin to not test our solution. Before submitting, make sure that at least your program outputs as the same as samples given. You also want to have
  test cases that include tricky corner cases and large cases.
- That one mantra: ‚ÄúPractice, practice, and practice!‚Äù and upsolve problems as many as you can. Expect that there will be the odds where you face 
  a similar problem to what you have tried/solved.
- If you are in a team contest, communication is key!
  
## How to use Online Judge platforms:
- Read problems &#8594; code &#8594; submit &#8594; let the judge do their work. Then, you shall see the feedback.
- What the verdict says about your solutions (AC, WA, TLE, RTE, CTE, etc.)
  - AC (Accepted): Congratulations! Your solution has passed all the test cases (including the hidden ones) and you are good to go to the next problem.
  - WA (Wrong Answer): You failed on some testcase(s)
  - TLE (Time Limit Exceeded): Your solution's running time exceeded the time limit

    While it is difficult to measure exact wall-clock time of your algorithm just by analyzing the algorithm and code, it is sometimes a good idea to
    benchmark your solution before you submit it to the judge. This way you trade a few minutes of time (constructing the worst-case input) for avoiding many time limit exceeded verdicts. If you are unsure of your solution
    and the competition format penalizes you for rejected submissions, this tradeoff can have good value.

  - RTE (Runtime Error): Your program crashed during execution with the secret test input
